After you have modified files and you want to add changes to the Git Repository do the following
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "A message here to describe the changes"`
* `git push origin master` - to push to the master branch

If you want to reset to a commit use:
* `git reset --hard HEAD` to reset to head (last commit)
* `git reset --hard <commit_id>` to reset to a chosen commit
